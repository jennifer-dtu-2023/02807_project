In the recommendation system I've designed, I utilize four distinct methods to curate film suggestions.

First, my basic similarity function identifies movies similar to 'Inception' based on genre and keywords, ensuring thematic alignment. Next, I apply a weighted function that factors in star power, acknowledging the influence of well-known actors.

Next, I apply a weighted function that factors in star power, acknowledging the draw of well-known actors.

With the Apriori genre-based approach, I discern patterns in genre preferences, inferring that if someone enjoys 'Action', they might also appreciate 'Thriller'.

Lastly, my enhanced function combines genre insights with star influence, as seen when suggesting movies in line with 'Die Hard'.

Together, these strategies provide users with a personalized recommendation system.
